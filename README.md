scitos_3d_mapping
=================

Tools for building 3D maps and using these maps for navigation and visualization.

At the moment this contains code and information for running the navigation stack together with the octomap 3d mapping tool. For information on octomap, have a look at: http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~hornunga/pub/hornung13auro.pdf

For instructions on how to get the dependencies and run octomap, have a look at: https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_3d_mapping_and_navigation/wiki/Get-up-and-running
