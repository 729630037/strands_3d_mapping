===================

This contains our implementation of a vocabulary tree (Nister & Stewenius) together with some modifications for our paper. It also includes some functions e.g. for extracting segments & features and querying on our data structure.

To use the system, follow the instructions in `scripts/menu.py`. There are submenus, for example for querying that can be run separately, i.e. `scripts/training_menu.py` and `scripts/querying_menu.py`.
